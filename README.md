# HIVE
### A screeps 

Personal scripts for screeps.

Written in an architecture of my own design: Hive

Main {a bunch of vars that need to be calculated once} ->
Category Overseer {decide what needs to be done and assigns workers for the job} ->
Category Worker {gets down and dirty in the mines, transfering resources, and the rest of the jobs}

Very much a work-in-progress
